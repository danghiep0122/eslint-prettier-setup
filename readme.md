How to make them work together?
ESLint has also formatting rules which could conflict with prettier. So we should configure it carefully (sounds tough but it is very simple ðŸ˜…)

Let's begin

Step 1 : -
```
npm install eslint --save-dev
```
 or
 ```
yarn add eslint --dev
```
Step 2 : -
Create .eslintrc.json by running
```
npx eslint --init
```
or
 ```
yarn run eslint --init
```

```
npm init @eslint/config
```
Step 3 : -
In React - 17.0.0, importing react to a file is optional,
To fix this, we will add a rule to our .eslintrc file. So open your .eslintrc file and add this line "react/react-in-jsx-scope": "off" inside the rules.
```
"rules": {
    "react/react-in-jsx-scope": "off"
  }
 ```
 
 Step 4 : -
If you are using jest then you will find that eslint is giving us an error that test or expect is not defined . To fix this we need to add "jest": true inside env.
```
"env": {
    "browser": true,
    "es2021": true,
    "jest": true
  }
```

Step 5 : -
Now, add esling plugins to make it work with react, and make proper configuration for eslint and prettier so that they don't collide with each other

Install
```
npm install eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier prettier --save-dev
```
or 
```
yarn add eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier prettier --dev
```

After installing above, make changes to .eslintrc file.
```
 "extends": ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:react/recommended", "plugin:prettier/recommended"]
```

We can run prettier separately but we want eslint to run it for us so that it does not conflict with the eslint rules.

Step 6: -
Create .prettierrc and paste the below code
```
{
  "semi": true,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "printWidth": 100,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "trailingComma": "none",
  "jsxBracketSameLine": true
}
```

Now, eslint and prettier is setup lets add the script to the package.json
```
"lint": "eslint .",
"lint:fix": "eslint --fix",
"format": "prettier --write './**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,css,md,json}' --config ./.prettierrc"
```
This should work but before you test it, it is better to restart your VSCode.

You are all setup to write your awesome code.
